### Call-Break-Card-Game-2D
Call Bridge

Call Bridge (also known as Call Break) is a classic trick-taking card game played with a standard 52-card deck. It is usually played by 4 players, where each player competes individually. The main objective of the game is to win as many tricks as possible based on the number of tricks (calls) a player bids at the beginning of each round.

🎮 Game Rules

The game is played with 52 cards (no jokers).

At the start of each round, every player must call (bid) the number of tricks they expect to win.

Spades are always the trump suit, meaning they beat cards from other suits.

Players take turns following the suit if possible; if not, they may play a trump card or discard another card.

At the end of the round, players earn points:

If they achieve their call, they score that many points.

If they win fewer tricks than their call, they receive negative points.

Extra tricks won (beyond the call) may add fractional or bonus points depending on the rule variation.

🏆 Objective

The player with the highest total score after all rounds is declared the winner.
